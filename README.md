# WIDS-Data-Challenge

### The WiDS Datathon 2023 focuses on a prediction task involving forecasting sub-seasonal temperatures (temperatures over a two-week period, in our case) within the United States. We are using a pre-prepared dataset consisting of weather and climate information for a number of US locations, for a number of start dates for the two-week observation, as well as the forecasted temperature and precipitation from a number of weather forecast models (we will reveal the source of our dataset after the competition closes). Each row in the data corresponds to a single location and a single start date for the two-week period. Your task is to predict the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum temperature over the next 14 days, for each location and start date.
